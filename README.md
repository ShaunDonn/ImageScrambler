# Rowing Training Logging Software
Purpose: created for my rowing coach. Built using Java. Functionality includes workout logging, athlete stat tracking, and workout searching, filtering, and sorting. Rowing-machine-themed GUI. 
NOTE: Note: this project was completed in 2017. Since then, I have learned a significant amount; if I were to do this project now, I would make a number of changes to improve efficiency, including using a pointer-based language (likely C++), an ordered tree data structure to make searching more efficient, and merge sort instead of bubble sort to make sorting more efficient.
